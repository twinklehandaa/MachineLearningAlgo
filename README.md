# Basics of Machine Learning

## 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing data, encoding categorical data, splitting the dataset into training and testing data, feature scaling

## 2. Simple Linear Regression
* It models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## 3. Multiple Linear Regression
* It is used to predict a continuous target variable based on the linear relationship between it and two or more predictor variables.

## 4. Logistic Regression
* It is used for binary classification tasks, i.e., it's used when you want to predict the probability of a data point belonging to one of two categories.

## 5. Decision Tree
* It is used for both classification and regression tasks, it recursively splits data based on features to create a tree-like structure that predicts outcomes based on decision rules.

## 6. KNN
## 7. Naives Bayes
## 8. K-means Clustering
## 9. Hierarchial Clustering
## 10. Backpropagation
